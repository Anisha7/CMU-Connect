            <h2> PROBLEM </h2>
            <br>
            <p> All online resources needed by a college student are 
                very cluttered among different websites. This adds 
                additional time-consuming work to the already over-busy 
                schedules of students. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Currently, the platforms in use by students and faculty
                in my university are SIO, Canvas, Gradescope, and Autolab. 
                SIO is the university's official site, which handles 
                finances and course lookup/registration. The other sites 
                are used by different classes to handle grading and online 
                submissions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Each student ends up using a variety of these sources for 
                their classes. It becomes a hassle to keep track of each 
                and every source. 
            </p>

            <h2> SOLUTION </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Compile all of this data into one website/portal. 
            </p>
